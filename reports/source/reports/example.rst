 Example Analysis Report 
#########################

Overview
=========

This is an example template. Reports should not be autogenerated from code output (your code and data can change over time). So save relevant plots in the /images/ directory and include them directly. Use this section to give an overview of the measurement/experiment/goal for your task.

Notebooks Used
==================

Include links to any :code:`*.ipynb` files that are used in generating the data.

Necessary Datasets
```````````````````

Cover which datasets were used for the analysis and what they were used for


Summary of Analysis
====================

Quickly summarize what was done to get the results, if you have to justify why you picked certain methods, do it here.

Results
========

This is where you should capture the actual results of the measurement. To easily create rst tables in VSCode look into the `VSCode Table Formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shuworks.vscode-table-formatter>`_ extension. If your code generated additional files/models that you've backed up with DVC, include links where they're stored or instructions for accessing.

+------------------+-------+----------+
| Item             | Value | Variance |
+------------------+-------+----------+
| apples           | 3     | 0.5      |
+------------------+-------+----------+
| oranges          | 2     | 0.1      |

Use the :code:`figure` rst directive to easily insert images with captions.

.. figure:: ../images/805-400x400.jpg
    :align: center

    A random photo with caption.

Conclusion
===========

If necessary, provide a short conclusion based on the results. This will also act as a reminder if you have to look at the report later on.
